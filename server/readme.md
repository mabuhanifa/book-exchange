I want you to generate a full-stack backend system plan for a **"Dhaka Local Book Exchange Marketplace"** app using **Express.js** and **Mongoose (MongoDB)**.

You must break the requirements down into **10 detailed .md files**, each file representing a different technical module or component. Each file should contain:

- Description of module
- Required models (Mongoose schemas)
- Required APIs (express routes)
- Business logic notes
- Validation & security considerations
- Example edge cases if applicable
- Any database relationships
